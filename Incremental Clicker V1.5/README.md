## This is my first personal project ever so do not expect anything crazy
## A little about me:
- I'm a computer engineering major in my 2nd semester entering 3rd
- I'm doing this project first and forward to make a game I find fun.
- I've only been coding for less than a year consistently inconsistent
- Only coding languages I've had experience with are Python, C, and a little bit of C++

## What led me to make this game:
- I've played many roblox incremental games so I've decided to try my hand at making my own outside of roblox
- There was one specific game where the developer had made the games about a year or two ago on his own website through github/git
- If I find his account again I'll be sure to link it below this so I can give credit because he inspired me to make my own incremental game
- https://github.com/MrRedShark77

## Installation (working on making this better)
- Clone this repo
- Run the game with 'python incremental.py' or whatever you use

## How to Play:
- Enter `1` to click.
- Enter `2` to upgrade clicking power.
- Enter `3` to upgrade auto-resources.
- Enter `q` to quit game and save.
- The goal is reach the "Beyond"

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

NOTE: THIS IS MY FIRST TIME USING GIT/CREATING MY OWN REPO/FIRST TIME EVERYTHING I AM VERY NEW TO THIS THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
Thank you for reading this and leave any criticism, comments, or concerns on the repo page thank you.

## UPDATED BY ME -MINDART-

## Incremental Clicker v1.5 - GUI Update

Overview
Incremental Clicker v1.5 - GUI Update introduces an exciting new graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, offering a smoother and more interactive experience. In addition to the core gameplay features, the update includes intuitive visual elements, new upgrade systems, and a helpful Read For You tutorial directly within the game, guiding players through the new GUI and features.

## What's New in v1.5?
Brand New GUI: The game now features a sleek, user-friendly interface where all actions, stats, and upgrades are clearly visible.

## Graphical User Interface
The core of v1.5 is the newly designed GUI. This update replaces the old console-based interface with a graphical window that organizes the key gameplay elements:
Resource Display: Shows your current resources and uses dynamic number formatting.
Upgrade Buttons: Buttons for upgrading both click power and auto-collection speed.
Resource Counter: Displays your current resource count, formatted with readable suffixes like "K" for thousands, "M" for millions, and so on.
Status Bar: Shows additional stats like your current click power, auto-collection rate, and the cost of upgrades.
