Read For You Tutorial - GUI and New Number Formatting (v1.5)
Welcome to the Read For You Tutorial for the Incremental Clicker v1.5 update! This tutorial will guide you through the newly implemented graphical user interface (GUI), explaining its structure and functionality. Additionally, we’ll break down the new number formatting system that ensures resource values are displayed in a more readable way as they grow.

This guide is designed for developers, so we’ll focus on the key concepts, code structure, and implementation details.

1. Overview of the GUI
The GUI was built using Python's Tkinter module. Here's an overview of the main components:

Key GUI Components
Main Window (root): This is the main frame of the game that holds all other elements.
Labels:
Resource Display: A Label widget to display the current resources.
Click Power: A Label widget that shows how much each click generates.
Auto-Collection Rate: A Label widget that displays the current auto-collection rate.
Milestones: A Label showing current milestones reached and the boosts they grant.
Buttons:
Click for Resources: A Button widget that increments the resource count when clicked.
Upgrade Click Power: A Button widget for upgrading the click power.
Upgrade Auto-Collection: A Button widget to upgrade the auto-collection rate.
Tutorial Button: A Button that opens the Read For You tutorial.
Example GUI Code
Here’s an outline of the key GUI initialization code:

python
Copy code
import tkinter as tk

# Main window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Incremental Clicker v1.5")

# Labels to display resources, click power, etc.
resource_label = tk.Label(root, text="Resources: 0", font=("Arial", 14))
resource_label.pack()

click_power_label = tk.Label(root, text="Click Power: 1", font=("Arial", 14))
click_power_label.pack()

auto_collection_label = tk.Label(root, text="Auto-Collection Rate: 0/sec", font=("Arial", 14))
auto_collection_label.pack()

# Buttons for interacting with the game
click_button = tk.Button(root, text="Click for Resources", command=click_for_resources)
click_button.pack()

upgrade_click_power_button = tk.Button(root, text="Upgrade Click Power", command=upgrade_click_power)
upgrade_click_power_button.pack()

upgrade_auto_collection_button = tk.Button(root, text="Upgrade Auto-Collection", command=upgrade_auto_collection)
upgrade_auto_collection_button.pack()

# Start the GUI
root.mainloop()
In this code:

Labels are used to display dynamic text that updates as the player interacts with the game.
Buttons are bound to functions (click_for_resources, upgrade_click_power, upgrade_auto_collection) that modify the game state when pressed.
2. The Read For You Tutorial System
The tutorial system is implemented using an additional Tkinter Toplevel window that opens when the player clicks the "Tutorial" button. This provides step-by-step instructions to guide the player through the game mechanics. The tutorial window consists of Label widgets to display the instructions and a Button to close the tutorial window.

Tutorial Code
python
Copy code
def show_tutorial():
    tutorial_window = tk.Toplevel(root)
    tutorial_window.title("Tutorial")

    instructions = [
        "Welcome to Incremental Clicker v1.5!",
        "Click the 'Click for Resources' button to earn resources.",
        "Upgrade your Click Power to earn more resources per click.",
        "Use 'Upgrade Auto-Collection' to automatically collect resources.",
        "Reach milestones to get permanent upgrades."
    ]

    # Display instructions in the tutorial window
    for instruction in instructions:
        label = tk.Label(tutorial_window, text=instruction, font=("Arial", 12))
        label.pack(padx=10, pady=5)

    # Close tutorial button
    close_button = tk.Button(tutorial_window, text="Close", command=tutorial_window.destroy)
    close_button.pack(pady=10)

thats all for now
